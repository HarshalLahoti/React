Why framework came in existence ?

Earlier the html css, and jabascript was rendered at server/ back end and it was send through the browser on which using 
jquery we used to render the pages. This is called as server-side rendering

with the framework like react it gave rise to single page application
Client side Rendering. All the HTML CSS and JS started working on browser.
Data comes from server via API. Submit the pages without page reloading. feels like local system.


Problems with Vanilla Javascript

What is front end application does 

Setting up Environment

- check what is node js version
- Install extension ESLint, Prettier - Code formatter
- One Monokai Theme, Material Icon Theme  Extension

Setting changes in vs code
- auto save 
- Default Formatter change to Prettier
- format on save 
- Eslint :Run change it to OnSave

to write an html in vs code we can just do !+Enter
